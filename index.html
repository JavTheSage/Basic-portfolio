    <p>My name is Javier Villegas Bautista, a 20 year old male originally from Dana Point, California. I am currently
      taking a coding boot camp program at UCI to attain the knowledge and skillset to become a web developer. After
      graduating from Dana Hills High School, I took several general ed classes at Saddleback Community College but did
      not settle on any favorable majors while there. After searching across the world (wide web) for a purpose, I
      stumbled upon UCI's coding boot camp and was hooked in by its glowing reviews. In pursuit of a useful skillset I
      set out on a journey to attend this program and was soon tasked with making this portfolio site as homework. And
      although it is shoddier than a shack built with twigs it is a WIP with more to add to it as the program goes on.

  <!--Pseudo code
  Need a white box fixated to middle of page, set there with float I believe, and fiddling with margin, padding, width,
  etc for dimensions.
  On the white box put a placeholder image on the left side with float left, and my 'about me' section to the right with
  float right.
  Add a footer that matches the dimensions and color id's from the gitlab instructions.
  Change font family in text to match the gitlab instructions.-->
